## Introduction

ARIEL consists of

(1) a zone-based clustering algorithm that accurately identifies in-room occupancy “hotspot(s)” using Wi-Fi signatures; 

(2) a motion-based clustering algorithm to identify inter-zone correlation, thereby distinguishing different rooms; 

(3) an energy-efficient motion detection algorithm to minimize the noise of Wi-Fi signatures.



• A zone-based clustering algorithm that accurately and automatically identifies in-room occupancy hotspot(s) using Wi-Fi signature;
• A motion-based clustering algorithm to identify interzone correlation, thereby distinguishing different rooms;
• An energy-efficient motion detection algorithm to minimize the noise of Wi-Fi signature.
